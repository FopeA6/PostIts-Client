We started by looking at the requirements of the website and then creating a design based on them. We created a plan in a shared in google docs on what we wanted to complete and allocated a time frame for each feature.


After the planning and designing process we started to mob program the initial HTML, Javascript and Server side JavaScript. This was done in order to have a basic functioning website before we branch and work on specific features.

We merged and pushed to the git repo everytime a new feature was completed.
